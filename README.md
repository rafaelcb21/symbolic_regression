# Symbolic Regression

# 1. Installation

Python version 3.7 or higher is required.
You need to install the `line_profiler` library using the command `pip install line-profiler`.

# 2. Usage

Run the main.py file to generate the dataset that will be used for Symbolic Regression.
A CSV file will be created for each algorithm present in the `python algorithm.py` file.
The created CSV will contain 1000 iterations for each algorithm, starting from iteration 2.
The `levenshteinDistance` algorithm should only be used with 300 iterations, which is why it is commented out.
